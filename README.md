What is Functional Data Analysis (FDA)?

In standard data analysis, the data points are usually discrete and finite. FDA treats data as continuous functions over time, space, or another domain. Instead of analyzing individual points, FDA models data as smooth curves or functions. For example, instead of looking at daily stock prices, FDA would model the entire price trajectory over time as a smooth function.

The advantage of it over standard data analysis is capturing trends. FDA inherently smooths data by fitting it into continuous functions, which helps in detecting long-term trends and underlying patterns while filtering out random noise. It is particularly good for analyzing temperature, growth curves, or stock prices over time.
